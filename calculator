/*
From the code below you can see that I have imported the “iostream” header to allow for user input and output. I have used the “using namespace std” to define
the scope. I have chosen to create the variables of “oper” to represent the operator, and “num1” and “num2” to represent the 
user input numbers. The function “cout” outputs data to the user, and “cin” takes input from the user. With that in mind the program takes operand input from 
the user and moves on to the control structure portion of the code. For this I have chosen “switch-case” over “if-else”.
*/


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
char oper;
float num1, num2;

cout << "Enter an opererator (+, -, *, /): ";
cin >> oper;

cout << "Enter two operands: ";

cin >> num1 >> num2;

// Control structure
switch (oper)
{
case '+':
cout << num1 + num2 << endl;
break;

case '-':
cout << num1 - num2 << endl;
break;

case '*':
cout << num1 * num2 << endl;
break;

case '/':
cout << num1 / num2 << endl;
break;

default:
// Break case - If opererator is other than (+, -, *, /)
cout << "Error! Please input a correct operator (+, -, *, /)";
break;
}

system("PAUSE");
return 0;
}
