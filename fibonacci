/*
Nicknamed “The Golden Ratio,” the Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which the
current number equals the sum of the two numbers before it. If you were to throw this into
a set, an example would be [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]. For the program itself,  it will take user
input as to how many calculated terms are requested, but use an example of twenty.
The variables “t1” and “t2” are defaulted to 0 and 1 respectively as we know those 
will be the fist two terms if printing the full sequence.
